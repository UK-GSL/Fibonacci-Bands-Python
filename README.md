# Fibonacci Bollinger Bands 

A simple script i wrote because i like Fibonacci Bollinger Bands and i couldn't find a version in python. 

basic formula is MA +/- (fib*(m*stddev))
Where fib represents fibonacci ratio, m represents the standard bollinger multiplier and MA represents the moving average, which currently is SMA. 

Also contains a basic function to plot the fibonacci bands on a OHLC chart using plotly (offline).
